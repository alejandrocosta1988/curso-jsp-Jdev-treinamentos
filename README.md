# curso-jsp-Jdev-treinamentos

This project is being developed following the instructions provided by a training program for Java Web Developers called "Formação Java Web Full-Stack". The course is a module called "Curso JSP" and focuses on JSP development.
Although following the instructions provided in the course, the code in this repository differs from the presented code in the course because I am trying to apply some concepts that I've been studying, such as clean code, junit unit testing for classes defined in the package `model`. These are not covered in the course, and were added by me.

The project is under development and will be commited here regurlary.
Feel free to get in contact if you're interested in Java Web Development using JSP.
